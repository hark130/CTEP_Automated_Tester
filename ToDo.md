## CURRENTLY ##
- [X] Determine files present  
- [X] Compile source code into object code  
- [ ] Link existing object code into a binary executable  
- [ ] Execute the binary  
- [ ] Save the output of the execution into a file  
    
## FUTURE ##
- [ ] Dynamically determine version of Visual Studio  
- [ ] Find fancy 'Windows' method of locating Visual Studio install path instead of hard-coding install directory
- [ ] Investigate CMake as a generic method of compilation that is compiler-agnostic(?)
- [ ] compile_source_to_object() in Tester_Functions.py
    - [ ] Adapt compile_source_to_object() to handle more than just C source code.  (CMake?)
    - [ ] If an old .obj is found, (store? and...) verify it was newly created
